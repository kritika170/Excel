EXCEL-used for documentation and data analytics.

DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA YOU CAN USE IN EXCEL

1. It is used for Data Analytics and Docunentation.
2. There are different types of data like numbers, text, date, currency, etc.
  a.We can see the text aligned to the left side of the block & the numbers aligned to the right side of the block.
  b.We can format numbers by adding the decimals or the precision.
  c.We can change the format of the date. (dd-mm-yyyy or dd month yyyy or dd/mm/yyyy or any other)
    Date is also a number. It starts counting the date from year 1900 and counts the number of days ahead.
    That is bascially the no of days passed from the year 1900. Hence we can convert a number to a date as well.
  d.We can also format the currency. ($10,000)


THE BASICS OF FORMATTING

1. If we want to change something in the entire sheet (maybe the font type of the entire sheet) 
   then we can click on the intersection of the rows and columns at the top left of the screen
   to select the entire sheet.
2. If a cell has contents that does not fit in the cell perfectly then we can click on the intersection of the two cells 
   that is the cell with the contents and the next cell and double click on it & it will automatically adjust for you.  
3. We can also put border around the table.
4. We can wrap the text that is written in a cell if the text is too long to fit in the cell.


SOME BASIC FUNCTIONS

1. We can insert a new column if we want to.
2. colon(:) is a range operator 
3. we can use functions such as 
   =SUM(C2:F2) which means sum the contents of C2,D2,E2,F2 
   =AVERAGE(C2:C4) which means calculate the average of C2,C3,C4
   =MIN(C2:C4) which means find the minimum value among the group of numbers
   =MAX(C2:C4) which means find the maximum value among the group of numbers
   =COUNT(C2:C4) this will be equal to 3 that is C2,C3,C4 (bascially counts the number of cells)
 

SOME COMPLEX FUNCTIONALITIES

1. =COUNTIF(C2:C4,">=90") 
   =COUNTIF(RANGE,CRITERIA) 
   this complex function will help you to count the cells that meet the given condition.

2. =SUMIF(G2:G4,">=75%",C2:C4)
   =SUMIF(RANGE,CRITERIA,SUM_RANGE)
   this will initially consider the range and will apply the condition on that particular range,
   then you will get a set of range that agrees to the condition and it will give you the sum of that range.

3. =SUMIF(G2:G4,">=75%",C2:C4)/COUNTIF(G2:G4,">=75%")
   this is a complex function to find the average 


VISUALISING DATA IN EXCEL

1. Select the data/columns that should appear in the form of a chart (visual representation) 
   Click on Insert -> Charts
   You will find different types of charts like pie chart, line chart, bar chart
2. We can switch row to column
3. We can also give title to the charts and apply font styles to it. Also every entity can be modified in the similar fashion.
4. The + sign is the 'chart elements' that helps us add more data to the charts and make it more readable.
   We can change the color of the charts.
5. The chart is linked to the data, so any changes in the data will lead to changes in the chart as well.
   Like for example we have a chart in the different section where the data of the chart is not available 
   & if we make changes in the original data it will be reflected on the chart as well.
   This is useful when we don't want to provide someone with the data but want to give the chart for analysis
   (bascially we can use the data in the backend and the chart in the frontend.)
6. We can use Pie chart with a single element.


PIVOT TABLES

1. The data variables are related to each other & this helps us to create pivot tables.
2. First select the entire table -> Go to Insert -> Select Pivot Table
3. Pivot Table Fields:-Filters, Rows, Columns, Values
   You can drag and drop the entities into these four fields & your table will be modified accordingly.
   We can also change the settings of the entities in the four fields (by default we get the sum)


THE VLOOKUP FUNCTION

1. It is a reference or a lookup function.
2. VLOOKUP stands for Vertical Lookup. Most of the things in excel are vertically aligned & not horizontally aligned.
   =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
-->=VLOOKUP(give a value, entire range of columns in which you might find the desired value, how many columns away from the value, 
   do we want approximate match (TRUE) or the exact match (FALSE))
   =VLOOKUP(210,A1:H4,8,FALSE)
   =VLOOKUP(D7,A1:H4,8,FALSE) --> In this case you will have to enter the value in the column D7 & you will get the corresponding output.
   This can be done in another sheet as well and the contents of the actual sheet will be linked to it,
   as long as it is in the same spreadsheet.
